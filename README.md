## LayerArrangeMoveOut
Moves the current layer into the parent group, positioning it above the current group. 
## LayerArrangeMoveUp

## LayerArrangeToBottom
Send the current layer to the bottom of the layer stack.  If the layer is currently in a group it will be moved to the outermost scope.  If the layer being moved is a mask or adjustment layer, it will be moved above the first raster or vector layer in the image.  If the image has a background layer, the layer will be moved above the background.

## LayerMergeVisible
Merge the visible layers in the current group into a single layer, preserving transparency.  The resulting layer is inserted at the position of the active layer.  Because layers are combined from different spots in the z-order, the image may look different when invisible layers are shown.  Groups that are siblings of the current layer are preserved or merged depending on the visibility of the group layer, not the visibility of its children.  If the current layer is not a member of a group all of the top level layers are used in the merge. 
## LayerPalMoveVectorObject
